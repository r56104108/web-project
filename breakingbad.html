    <p><span><b>Breaking Bad</b></span> is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. Set and
        filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
        overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of
        stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron
        Paul), to produce and distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while
        navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and
        concluded on September 29, 2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes.</p>

    <p>Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt
        and Dean Norris as Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent. Others include Bob Odenkirk
        as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike Ehrmantraut,
        and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally
        ambitious Todd Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business executive secretly managing
        Walter's global meth sales for her company.</p>

    <h2>Premise</h2>
    <p>Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010,[7] Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a modest high school
        chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless kingpin in the local methamphetamine drug trade, driven to
        financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. Initially making only
        small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab, Walter and Jesse eventually
        expand to make larger batches of special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes
        on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walter eventually finds
        himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) through his brother-in-law Hank
        Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and
        his family's lives at risk.</p>
